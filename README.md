 Using cutting-edge smartphone technology, the Augmented Reality (AR) Furniture Shopping App is revolutionizing the way people shop for furniture. Before making a purchase, customers may see furniture pieces in their own homes thanks to the app's realistic and interactive shopping experience. The app increases user interest and confidence in furniture choosing by merging the virtual and real worlds. With the help of augmented reality technology, users may snap images of the furniture using their camera or upload images from their gallery to see how it will look in their house.
